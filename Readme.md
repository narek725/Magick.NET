# The .NET wrapper for the ImageMagick library: Magick.NET

ImageMagick is a powerful image manipulation library that supports over [100 major file formats](www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php) (not including sub-formats). With Magick.NET you can use ImageMagick in your C#/VB.NET/.NET Core application without having to install ImageMagick on your server or desktop.
